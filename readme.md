## FEATURES 

* Change the VND currency symbol `đ` to anything, e.g: `VND`, `VNĐ`, `đồng`, etc.
* Add provinces for Vietnam when visitors select Vietnam as a country of the shipping (billing) address. This is not available in WooCommerce by default.
* Add districts to Vietnam provinces.
* Convert `000` of prices to `K` (or anything). E.g: `50000` (VND) will be `50K` (VND), or `50 thousand` (VND).
* Support `VND` for [the PayPal Standard gateway](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/paypal-standard/). Convert `VND` prices to any PayPal supported currency before sending visitors to the PayPal pages.
* Add [the OnePay domestic (local ATM cards) gateway](http://onepay.com.vn/).

## ROAD MAP 

In the future, this plugin will add more and more features for the Vietnam market:

* Integrate all districts to Vietnam provinces.
* Integrate at least one solution for collecting money by phone cards.
* Integrate the Vietnam payment gateways like 1Pay, OnePay, BaoKim, Ngan Luong, etc.
* Integrate the Vietnam shipping solutions like ShipChung, Giaohangnhanh, ViettelPost, etc.
